      <description>I am a part time graduate student at Upenn MCIT program. In this summer, I took CIT591 - Introduction to Software Development course in which we created a Java based app as final team project.
We built a tool that is designed to compare public companies reported earnings and consensus estimate and present a direct visualization to user. Users of our tool can utilize the data points analysis to make investment decisions.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; My blog is officially launched. This is the first time I built a website from stretch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much when I decided not to use a blog builder. For one, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay the fee. For two, WordPress is blocked by the GFW. The level of difficulty was unexpected. It took me a whole week to get it up there. I&amp;rsquo;m having a two week</description>

      <description>About me Hi, Welcome to my blog.
Initially, I wanted to create a blog to display my projects. After I spent so much time learning how to build a site using Github pages and Hugo, I think I am obligated to myself to keep writing posts. My avatar is an illustration from YAOYAO MA VAN. I love her painting. My blog template is Clear White created by Zhaohua Bing. Thanks a lot.</description>
