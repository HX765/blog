      <description>I am a part time graduate student at Upenn MCIT program. In this summer, I took CIT591 - Introduction to Software Development course in which we created a Java based app as final team project.
We built a tool that is designed to compare public companies reported earnings and consensus estimate and present a direct visualization to user. Users of our tool can utilize the data points analysis to make investment decisions.</description>
