## About me

Hi, Welcome to my blog.

Initially, I wanted to create a blog to display my projects. After I spent so much time learning how to build a site using *[Github pages](https://pages.github.com)* and *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)*, I think I am obligated to myself to keep writing posts. <img align="right" src=/img/avatar-small.jpg>

My avatar is an illustration from *[YAOYAO MA VAN](https://www.yaoyaomavanas.com)*. I love her painting. My blog template is *[Clear White](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cleanwhite)* created by Zhaohua Bing. Thanks a lot. My website background images are selected from *[Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/royalty-free-images/)*.

I am a part-time graduate student of Computer and Information Technology at University of Pennsylvania (MCIT@Upenn).
